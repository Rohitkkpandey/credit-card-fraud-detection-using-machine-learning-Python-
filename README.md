Project Structure
Explain the directory structure of the project, highlighting important files and directories. For example:

data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
src/: Contains the source code for the fraud detection model.
models/: Stores pre-trained machine learning models.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
README.md: This documentation file.
Usage
Explain how to use the project once it's set up. Provide examples of how to run the application and what to expect.

For instance, you can describe how to run the real-time fraud detection system, how to input transactions for evaluation, and how to receive alerts or notifications for potentially fraudulent transactions.

Model Training
Explain how the machine learning model was trained. Provide details on the dataset used, data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, and the machine learning algorithms employed. Include any hyperparameters that were tuned.

Evaluation
Describe how the model's performance is evaluated, including the evaluation metrics used (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score). Provide guidelines on how to interpret the results and adjust the system's thresholds.

Contributing
Explain how others can contribute to the project, whether it's through bug reporting, feature requests, or code contributions. Provide guidelines for code style and how to submit pull requests.

License
State the project's license, such as MIT, Apache, or any other applicable license.
